      <description>Here is where the garden is at half–way through November&amp;hellip; Spinach grew from direct sow. Spring onions to the left are very slow but haven&amp;rsquo;t died. 2 Apollo tomatoes and a yellow one on the far left. Rocket has shot up from seed. Another batch on the way. Calendula taking up a lot of space at the front but has some flowers for Winnie. There is also a chilli in there, maybe that will grow in the warmer weather coming.</description>
