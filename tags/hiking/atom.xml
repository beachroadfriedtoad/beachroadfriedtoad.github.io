      <description>Last weekend Dad and I hiked to Pelion Hut via the Arm River Track. The weather was forecast to be overcast and light showers for all 3 days â€“ but I have never had such great weather up in the highlands. Max of 13-14 degs and almost no wind. On the Friday we walked in via the Arm River Track, about a 10-11km walk in the end. We eventually found a camp spot just outside Pelion Hut.</description>
