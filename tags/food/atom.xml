      <description>Here is where the garden is at half–way through November&amp;hellip; Spinach grew from direct sow. Spring onions to the left are very slow but haven&amp;rsquo;t died. 2 Apollo tomatoes and a yellow one on the far left. Rocket has shot up from seed. Another batch on the way. Calendula taking up a lot of space at the front but has some flowers for Winnie. There is also a chilli in there, maybe that will grow in the warmer weather coming.</description>

      <description>A post dedicated to the treats of Tassie. Will add more as I find them. 1. Scottsdale Cottage Bakery Ask for an egg roll – warmed in the microwave with butter and relish. $3.50. Chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss. 2. Chilla&amp;rsquo;s Takeaway Devonport Breakfast wrap. Egg, bacon, hashbrown, cheese, BBQ sauce. 3. Latrobe Bakery Egg &amp;amp; bacon roll. $2.80 each. 4. Detention River Store Sweet Chilli, Cheese and Bacon, Chicken Schnitzel Roll. $10.80. Crazy invention.</description>
