      <description>I installed the latest firmware udpate to my Sony a7iii (with much difficulty) to get the new intervalometer feature.
Using it to try out a new video format idea I have had. Put simply, a series of timelapse sequences - all from the same scene. But the timelapses are short interval, around 1 second, longer than your average burst mode yet short enough to cover 10-20 seconds of action.
Combining the nostalgic quality of photos and the immersive effect of video.</description>
