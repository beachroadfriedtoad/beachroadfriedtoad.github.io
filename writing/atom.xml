      <description>Around a week ago I returned from my work&amp;rsquo;s annual getaway. This year staying at the boss&amp;rsquo; accommodation in Derby.
I took the camera to make a quick video for socials. Was fun to have a go at shooting mountain biking.
I&amp;rsquo;m finding my new Sigma 35mm f1.4 is perfect for this kind of video.</description>

      <description>Last weekend Dad and I hiked to Pelion Hut via the Arm River Track. The weather was forecast to be overcast and light showers for all 3 days – but I have never had such great weather up in the highlands. Max of 13-14 degs and almost no wind. On the Friday we walked in via the Arm River Track, about a 10-11km walk in the end. We eventually found a camp spot just outside Pelion Hut.</description>

      <description>I installed the latest firmware udpate to my Sony a7iii (with much difficulty) to get the new intervalometer feature.
Using it to try out a new video format idea I have had. Put simply, a series of timelapse sequences - all from the same scene. But the timelapses are short interval, around 1 second, longer than your average burst mode yet short enough to cover 10-20 seconds of action.
Combining the nostalgic quality of photos and the immersive effect of video.</description>

      <description>Beach Road Fried Toad.
This is my corner of the internet. A place which isn&amp;rsquo;t social media to leave whatever I have been working on or doing, in a format which lends itself to archive more than attention.
Video, photo, family, home, travels, food, music, projects – anything really.
Minimal text, minimal fluff. Some kind of diary, some kind of blog.
