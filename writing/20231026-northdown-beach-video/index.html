<h1>Northdown Beach Video</h1>
<p>I installed the latest firmware udpate to my Sony a7iii (with much difficulty) to get the new intervalometer feature.</p>
<p>Using it to try out a new video format idea I have had. Put simply, a series of timelapse sequences - all from the same scene. But the timelapses are short interval, around 1 second, longer than your average burst mode yet short enough to cover 10-20 seconds of action.</p>
<p>Combining the nostalgic quality of photos and the immersive effect of video.</p>
<p>For this video the intervalometer was set to 1 second intervals for 20 seconds.</p>
